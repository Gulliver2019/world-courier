# NOTES FOR ALEX 

Hi Alex 

Virtually all my work is for agencies where I am granted a temporary access to their repos on an as and when basis and also where I am under NDAs to share their code with other people - I am sure you can understand.  There are some examples here of landing pages that were created for a company called Ledger Bennett that I am happy to share with you due to my relationship with the client.  

Most of my work for them is in the realms of HTML emails but these were some bootstrap landing pages that are being injected into a CMS platform as page templates.

I hope this is ok for you to have an intial look at.

Kind regards

Graham
